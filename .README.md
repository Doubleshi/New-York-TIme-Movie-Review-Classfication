Analysis database

I found there are 918 movie in 309 genres, and there are title, movie information, distributor, release date, sales, movie runtime, license as columns in data frame.

Option1 : I want to get the category of films by analysis the name

- Splitting the keywords in film name, and making them as features, and use genre as label
- I find there are some numbers in the name may effect the accuracy, but I didn't find a way to ignore them
- I also think if I can split each genre into individual words, such as Action as one genre, instead of 'Action', 'Adventure', 'Animation', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Sci-Fi'

Option2: I want to get the category of films by analysis the movie info

- I want to call out Movie_Info from data frame in definition features, but it shows error, so I use to_list to convert series as a list
- when I create feature_sets, it shows Movie_Info is not defined
- Failed T T

Option3: I want to get the category of films by analysis the distributor

- I just copy paste from the option 1, but it shows series object has no attribute lower, but when I use title.lower() it works, using distributor.lower() is wrong... very confused
- Also, in the distributor, sometime there are not only one company, but I don't know how to split the company instead of each word, and I also think if I can ignore words, such as studio/Cinema/Pictures/Motion can improve the accuracy
